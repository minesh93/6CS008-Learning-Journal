The order of magnitude function describes the part of T(n) that increases the fastest as the value of n increases. Order of magnitude is often called <b>Big-O notation</b> (for \"order\") and written as <b>O(f(n))</b>. It is also called <b>Asymptotic</b> notation to give it it's mathematical name. Big-O notation provides a useful approximation to the actual number of steps in the computation. The function f(n) provides a simple representation of the dominant part of the original T(n).<br><br>"
