; Universal Turing machine

;-- Initial State keep moving right until the end(space reached) then drop a marker
0 0 * r 0
0 1 * r 0
0 _ ! l grabNumber

;-- Grab the current number and set state to move whatever number we chosen i.e if a 0 then set state to move0 also replace that number with a & 
grabNumber 0 & r move0
grabNumber 1 & r move1


;-- Keep moving right until we find a place then drop that number where the space is then change state to be moveToStart
move0 ! * r move0
move0 & * r move0
move0 0 * r move0
move0 1 * r move0
move0 _ 0 l moveToStart

;-- Same applies for moving 1 along once a space has been found change state to moveToStart after dropping/placing the one
move1 ! * r move1
move1 & * r move1
move1 0 * r move1
move1 1 * r move1
move1 _ 1 l moveToStart


;-- moveToStart will move back to the most recent number avoiding the markers. Once a number is found it is then grabbed.
moveToStart ! * l moveToStart
moveToStart 0 * l moveToStart
moveToStart 1 * l moveToStart
moveToStart & * l fetchNumber
fetchNumber & * l fetchNumber
fetchNumber 0 * * grabNumber
fetchNumber 1 * * grabNumber

;-- If moving left we find no numbers meaning the reverse operation is complete then erase the markers placed
fetchNumber _ * r eraseMarker
eraseMarker & _ r eraseMarker
eraseMarker ! _ r eraseMarker
